## Course Overview and Learning Objectives

With rapid digitization, we do not only get connected, but also connect faster and generate more content all of which are stored at clouds and data warehouses for various reasons. There is huge amount of data out there to be analyzed, millions of questions to be answered, and millions of algorithms to be developed to better analyze this data. Current Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning practices focus solely on handling this data and extracting insights. Among all the various data types, perhaps the most challenging one is _text data_. The challenge of the text data comes from its differing use across individuals and its flexibility in expressing different concepts/objects/emotions which are primarily because we are performing a linguistic analysis. In this class, we not only discuss AI/ML applications on Text Mining but also focus on the interpretive nature of it. We also cover some of the _bad algorithms_ and discuss the societal impacts.
