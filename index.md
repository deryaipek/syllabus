## Course Overview and Learning Objectives

With rapid digitization, we do not only get connected, but also connect faster and generate more content all of which are stored at clouds and data warehouses for various reasons. There is huge amount of data out there to be analyzed, millions of questions to be answered, and millions of algorithms to be developed to better analyze this data. Current Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) practices focus solely on handling this data and extracting insights. Among all the various data types, perhaps the most challenging one is _text data_. The challenge of the text data comes from its differing use across individuals and its flexibility in expressing different concepts/objects/emotions which are primarily because we are performing a linguistic analysis. In this class, we not only discuss ML/DL applications on Text Mining but also focus on the interpretive nature of it. We also cover some of the _bad algorithms_ and discuss the societal impacts.

**Learning Objectives**
1. Help students have a deeper understanding of the ML/DL applications on Text Data
2. Provide students with the recent text mining practices and the research methodologies
3. Help students understand the challenges and pitfalls of text mining applications using _bad_ text mining applications
4. Help students gain a familiarity to the field at the level of utilizing and understanding the research papers of the field

## Requirements

There are no prerequisites for this course. However, to think for your best, we require a certain level of machine learning and Python knowledge/experience. You should have a basic understanding of the conventional ML methods such as Naive Bayes, Classification Trees, and Neural Networks. If you do not have the background but want to take this class, I can provide you with some tutorials so that you can catch up the content.

This class has a 20% attendance requirement. While I would like to provide you with the flexibility to follow the class within your availability, I also want to get to know all of you! Therefore, there is an attendance requirement.
